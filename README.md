# Agrotech-Final Project- ‚ÄúCutting-Edge Closed-Environment System for Monitoring Microbial Metabolism and Viability‚Äù
## Project Goal :sparkles:
Our goal is to track metabolism indicators by the use of sensors to assess microbial viability within a closed system over time, where a peristaltic pump that refreshes the air once CO‚ÇÇ concentration reaches a specific threshold.
### Background
The incubator we developed is designed for evaluating the metabolic processes of various microorganisms, including bacteria and algae, with a focus on their respiratory mechanisms. For instance, bacteria that engage in aerobic respiration will exhibit oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide emission. Conversely, algae, which undergo photosynthesis, will absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment.
### System Concept
The system is equipped with a range of sensors: CO‚ÇÇ , O‚ÇÇ , temperature, humidity, and light intensity to track environmental conditions. Data from these sensors is transmitted to our [Thingspeak Channel](https://thingspeak.com/channels/2595959). When CO‚ÇÇ levels reach a predefined threshold (1000 ppm, 400-10000 ppm range), The system automatically activates two peristaltic pumps: one to introduce fresh air into the closed environment and another to expel used air, ensuring optimal conditions for precise microbial viability assessment.

‚ùó**Disclaimers:**
* We were able to only monitor, Light, humidity and temperature. CO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ sensors were simulated using Potentiometers and code that set out to ‚Äúfake‚Äù CO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ data.

# Construction:

## Prototype
The initial setup involved integrating various sensors, including the photoresistor and SHT31, with the ESP32 microcontroller to verify basic functionality. To simulate the CO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ sensors, we utilized two potentiometers programmed to generate "fake" CO‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ data. This allowed us to control the peristaltic pumps and provide data for presentation purposes. the relays were connected to control the peristaltic pumps. Subsequently, the peristaltic pumps were integrated into the system. Finally, we developed and implemented the code to upload all collected data to ThingSpeak for monitoring and analysis.
The system was assembled on a breadboard to validate the design before integrating it into a more permanent solution.
